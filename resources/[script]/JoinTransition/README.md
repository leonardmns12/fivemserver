# JoinTransition
A simple script that adds a transition between the loading screen and spawning in-game. Should work with most custom loading screens, as well as the stock FiveM loading screen.

## Issues
- There might be a few issues, because joining servers can sometimes be glitchy, this is usually caused by some buggy resource.
